                      <p1>Some of my interests include playing softball and drawing. I have been involved with the BYTE tutoring program at BHS which tutors elementary school students free of cost. I have taken some entry engineering courses throughout this summer which have really sparked my interest in participating in the program. I have been able to incorporate my love for drawing with engineering and it has been an amazing experience for me.</p1>

He is currently taking Calculus 2. This summer, I took a calculus-based economics course at the University of Chicago and completed a few programming courses on the side. In addition to being interested in math, Michael is also interested in robotics, computer science, chemistry, economics, piano, and tennis.</p1>

                      <p1>Hi my name is Mia Gilmore, I'm a Junior in High School and have been working with GBStem for about a year teaching Scratch classes to elementary school students and helping with outreach. Some of my hobbies include baking, editing videos and playing tennis. I love coding and all things computer science and intend to continue it in the future and after high school. </p1>

                      <p1>Sarah first began coding as a child, mostly on block-based coding platforms like Scratch. Now as a high school junior, she is adept in coding languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, and HTML. She has over 5 years of experience in Scratch and taught Scratch classes with gbSTEM last year. Sarah also works full-time as a lead instructor at Empow Studios over the summer, and part-time during the school year. There, she can be found teaching subjects such as Scratch, Python, Minecraft Modding, and more. 

                        Additionally, she often finds herself working to make her community a more diverse and inclusive place through both school and community-based organizations. In her limited free time, she enjoys reading, cooking, baking, and playing games with friends and family.
