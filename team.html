I had so much fun working with the students and cannot wait to continue to see their competitiveness and creativity come to light during this semester's math/engineering competitions and hackathons. Outside of gbSTEM, I am a part of the Varsity Girls crew team at CRI and in school clubs such as the Climate Action club and the Analyzing LGBTQ+ Literature club. I also love cooking, watching classic films, and spending time with my friends. I am so excited for this new semester!</p1>
