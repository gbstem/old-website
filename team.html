                      <p1>Michael Bolgov has been interested in math 3 for many years and taught math at gbSTEM last year. Michael has been teaching math for over 3 years with various programs. He is currently taking Calculus 2. This summer, I took a calculus-based economics course at the University of Chicago and completed a few programming courses on the side. In addition to being interested in math, Michael is also interested in robotics, computer science, chemistry, economics, piano, and tennis.</p1>

                      <p1>Hi, my name is Michelle and I am a junior at Brookline High School. I was first introduced to the world of engineering through engineering courses I took at my school, during which I tackled challenges such as developing sustainable solutions for food waste. I love engineering because it allows me to combine my passions for math, science, and art to design potential solutions for issues that I care about. Aside from engineering, I have taught Scratch at gbSTEM in the past, and I am also a member of my local Sunrise Movement chapter. My other interests include visual arts, music, and fencing.</p1>

                      <p1>Beau Hayes-Pollard is a senior at Brookline High School. He learned to code in 6th grade after watching YouTube videos on how to create cheats/hacks for his favorite video games. Last summer, Beau interned at Bit Project, a student-run organization based out of UC Davis, where he worked with Azure Functions and C++ to make an IoT heart-rate monitor. Currently, he is developing a social media platform for students interested in STEM with his friends.</p1>
