                            <p1>Elena has loved math ever since her childhood. In high school, she was one of the captains of the math team, and she participated in competitions such as the AMC (American Math Competition) and the AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Exam), a three-hour examination that she has qualified for three times. In her freshman year, she made the Distinguished Honor Roll on the AMC 10, placing her at the top 1% of competitors. She has also competed at the Harvard-MIT Math Tournament and at the Math Prize for Girls at MIT. She has attended Canada/USA Mathcamp and participated in the MIT PRIMES Circle reading group. In her spare time, she enjoys creative writing, reporting, and drawing.</p1>

Now as a high school junior, she is adept in coding languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Java. She taught with gbSTEM as a Scratch instructor during the Spring 2021 semester, and has been helping out with the Scratch and Python curriculum ever since. Sarah also works full-time as a lead instructor at Empow Studios over the summer, and part-time during the school year. There, she can be found teaching subjects such as Scratch, Python, Minecraft Modding, and more.</p1>

I was first introduced to the world of engineering through engineering courses I took at my school, during which I tackled challenges such as developing sustainable solutions for food waste. I love engineering because it allows me to combine my passions for math, science, and art to design potential solutions for issues that I care about. Aside from engineering, I have taught Scratch at gbSTEM in the past, and I am also a member of my local Sunrise Movement chapter. My other interests include visual arts, music, and fencing.</p1>
