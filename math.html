                <p1>We are offering four different mathematics courses during the spring semester. Each course teaches enrichment topics and content outside of the standard school curriculum.</p1>
                <p1>Please check the course descriptions and the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> before enrolling your child in a program. We are so excited to be able to work with your family this fall!</p1>

                <h2>Are you ready?</h2>
                <p1>Students looking to enroll in Mathematics I should be comfortable with the number system, as well as with addition and subtraction of numbers less than 100. They should already be able to identify two-dimensional shapes, add and subtract multiples of 10, and tell time on an analog clock.</p1>
                <h2>What will this course cover?</h2>
                <p1>In Mathematics I, we will enhance the school curriculum for grades 2-3. We will establish familiarity with addition and subtraction of larger numbers. Then we will proceed onto basic multiplication, area and perimeter, fractions, and negative numbers. Since most of the students are very young, this will be a slower-paced course, with lots of individualized time for each student.</p1>

                <h2>Are you ready?</h2>
                <p1>If you are looking to enroll your child in Mathematics II, they should already be comfortable with the addition and subtraction of numbers up to 1000. They should also be familiar with multiplication and division up until 10 x 10. They should understand how to round numbers, compare fractions, and estimate the answers to addition and subtraction problems.</p1>
                <h2>What will this course cover?</h2>
                <p1>In this class, we will begin building the foundations of algebra. After solidifying their multiplication and division skills, students will begin solving one-step equations and more complicated word problems. We will also introduce negative numbers, decimals, and more advanced area and perimeter problems. Our goal is to equip students with the critical thinking and problem-solving skills that will help them succeed in middle school and beyond. </p1>

                <p1>Students in Mathematics III should already be comfortable with multiplying and dividing fractions, decimals, and numbers less than 1000. They should be able to calculate the area of rectangles, triangles, and circles. Students should also have some basic familiarity with solving one- and two-step equations.</p1>
                <h2>What will this course cover?</h2>
                <p1>In this class, we will ensure that the student has a comprehensive grasp of middle-school mathematics. We will teach them how to solve simultaneous equations, how to work with radicals and exponents, and how to use the Pythagorean theorem. We will also learn how to calculate volume. This will be a faster-paced course, so each student will receive lots of individualized support.</p1>

                <h2>Are you ready?</h2>
                <p1>Students looking to enroll in Mathematics IV should be completely familiar with most aspects of the middle school school curriculum. They should be comfortable with solving one- and two-step equations, and they should have a good grasp of area, perimeter, volume, factoring numbers, and solving simultaneous linear equations. They need to have very strong critical thinking and reasoning skills. In many cases, students in this course will be very successful members of their school math teams.</p1>
                <h2>What will this course cover?</h2>
                <p1>This course will equip students with the skills to be successful in math competitions such as the American Math Competition (AMC), IMLEM, and MathCounts. We will teach students strategies for factoring polynomials; permutations and combinations; the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion, and more. This class will be mostly problem-based, and our instructors will have been very successful in past math competitions. This course will be fast-paced, so please enroll your child only if they have the necessary prerequisites.</p1>
