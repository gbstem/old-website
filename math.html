                <p1>We are offering five different mathematics courses during the spring semester. Each course teaches enrichment topics and content outside of the standard school curriculum. There is an emphasis on creative thinking, problem-solving, and competition math strategies. Each class will also feature fun brainteasers and logic puzzles. All courses will be largely problem-based, with a short lesson at the beginning. </p1>
                <h1>Each math course is broken down into two semesters with different content. For example, Math I includes Math Ia for the Fall semester and Math Ib for the Spring semester. If you child was enrolled for a math course during the gbSTEM Fall 2022 semester, they should enroll in a second semester of that same course. We will update course descriptions for each semester of content in the next few days. </h1>     
                <p1>Please check the course descriptions and the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> before enrolling your child in a program. We are so excited to be able to work with your family this fall!</p1>
