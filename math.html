                <p1>We are offering five different mathematics courses during the spring semester. Each course teaches enrichment topics and content outside of the standard school curriculum. There is an emphasis on creative thinking, problem-solving, and competition math strategies. Each class will also feature fun brainteasers and logic puzzles. All courses will be largely problem-based, with a short lesson at the beginning. </p1>
                
                <p1>To determine the best course decision, students should take our placement exam. A score of 60% or higher is needed to place into a given level. A brief description of our math classes can be found below, but we highly recommend using our exam to determine class placement. </p1>
                
                <p1>Please check the course descriptions and the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> before enrolling your child in a program. We are so excited to be able to work with your family this fall!</p1>

                <h2>Are you ready?</h2>
                <p1>Students looking to enroll in Mathematics II should be comfortable with the number system, as well as with addition and subtraction of any number. They should also know basic multiplication. They should have a thorough understanding of 2-dimensional shapes and be able to calculate area and perimeter of rectangles.</p1>
                <h2>What will this course cover?</h2>
                <p1>In Mathematics II, we will practice multiplication and division of larger numbers. We will practice area and perimeter, fractions, and negative numbers. Since most of the students are young, this will be a slower-paced course, with lots of individualized time for each student.</p1>

                <h2>Are you ready?</h2>
                <p1>If you are looking to enroll your child in Mathematics III, they should also be familiar with multiplication of 2-digit numbers. They should also be fluent with long division. They should understand how to round numbers, compare fractions, and estimate the answers to addition and subtraction problems. They should know how to add and subtract fractions.</p1>
                <h2>What will this course cover?</h2>
                <p1>In this class, we will begin building the foundations of algebra. After solidifying their multiplication and division skills, students will begin solving one-step equations and more complicated word problems. We will also introduce negative numbers, decimals, and more advanced area and perimeter problems. Our goal is to equip students with the critical thinking and problem-solving skills that will help them succeed in middle school and beyond. </p1>

                <h2>Are you ready?</h2>
                <p1>Students in Mathematics IV should already be comfortable with multiplying and dividing fractions, decimals, and numbers. They should be able to calculate the area of rectangles, triangles, and circles. Students should also have some basic familiarity with solving one- and two-step equations, with understanding of order of operations. They should understand exponent rules. They should also know how to analyze data with mean, median, and mode.</p1>
                <h2>What will this course cover?</h2>
                <p1>In this class, we will ensure that the student has a comprehensive grasp of middle-school mathematics. We will teach them how to solve simultaneous equations, how to work with radicals and exponents, and how to use the Pythagorean theorem. We will also learn how to calculate volume for more complex shapes. This will be a faster-paced course, so each student will receive lots of individualized support.</p1>
