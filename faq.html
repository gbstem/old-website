                        <summary>How much do lessons cost?</summary>
                        <p>All lessons are free of charge. We do not want tuition to be a deterrent for any student who is interested in participating in our program.</p>

                        <summary>How will lessons be conducted?</summary>
                        <p>All sessions will be conducted remotely via Zoom, in groups of about than 5 students. See our Classes tab to see what content in covered in each lesson. Visit our logistics tab for more information.</p>

                        <summary>How frequently do lessons take place?</summary>
                        <p>Students are expected to be able to commit to at least TWO 45-60 minute long sessions a week for the CS track and at least TWO 45-60 minute long sessions a week for the math track. Students are also recommended to spend time outside of lessons to work on the material.</p>

                        <p>gbSTEM Spring 2021 will run from March 6th to June 19th.</p>

                        <summary>What grade levels is gbSTEM for?</summary>
                        <p>We accept students in grades K-8, but our courses are designed for grades 2-8 so unless a K-1 student has really high mathematical ability, they will most likely not be able to participate in the program. Most of our students are in grades 5-7.</p>

                        <summary>Can I join both the Computer Science and the Mathematics track?</summary>
                        <p>Yes, but you need to be sure that you are able to manage the time commitment of 4 hours a week of lessons, in addition to the work spent at home practicing the material.</p>

                        <summary>Do I need any prior coding experience?</summary>
                        <p>No prior coding experience is needed -- we welcome coders of all skill levels! In fact, most of our students have not coded before participating in the gbSTEM program.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>I have a bit of coding experience. Should I still join the program?</summary>
                        <p>Yes! If you are already familiar with coding basics, you may be able to enroll in a more difficult course such as Python or Java.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Which programming languages are offered?</summary>
                        <p>We offer introductory courses in Scratch, Python, and Java.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Which programming language should I pick?</summary>
                        <p>It is ultimately up to the student, but generally, we recommend Scratch for students in grades 2-5 and Python for students in grades 6-8, and Java for students who already have sigificant text-based programming experience. Our Java option will be more challenging than our Python option, as our Java lessons will cover the basics of object-oriented programming, while our Python lessons will not. More details on this can be found here.</p>

                        <summary>Do I need to take the Scratch course before taking the Python/Java course?</summary>
                        <p>No, each of our courses are introductory and stand-alone. However, if you have experience in Scratch and/or already have a grasp on some programming concepts, you may be able to proceed faster when taking the Python/Java courses.</p>

                        <summary>What does a typical lesson in the Computer Science track look like?</summary>
                        <p>Our lessons are typically an hour long each and will consist of a "lesson" portion and a "mini-project" portion. During the "lesson" portion, instructors will introduce students to a new programming concept. During the "mini-project" portion, students will code a small project that applies the topics and skills learned in the lesson.</p>

                        <summary>Can I enroll my student at a grade level higher than what's recommended?</summary>
                        <p>Yes, absolutely. If you have a talented second grader, feel free to enroll him/her in the Mathematics II course, if you think it's the best fit. However, you should ensure that your child is comfortable with the prerequisites and is able to keep up with the class.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Can I learn competition math / math not covered in typical K-12 school curricula?</summary>
                        <p>Yes. All of our courses will include material not typically covered in the recommended grade levels. Our Mathematics IV course focuses almost entirely on competition math and problem-solving strategies.</p>

                        <summary>What does a typical lesson in the Mathematics track look like?</summary>
                        <p>We will begin with a brief lecture; this will last about ten minutes. Afterwards, students will work on problems, either individually or in groups. They can receive help and support from the instructor at any point during the lesson.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>How many students will be enrolled in each class?</summary>
                        <p>We anticipate that class sizes will be quite small, since there will be multiple instructors for each level. There will probably be only 2-4 students in each class, but Mathematics IV classes may be a bit larger.</p>
