                        <summary>How much do lessons cost?</summary>
                        <p>All lessons are free of charge. We do not want tuition to be a deterrent for any student who is interested in participating in our program.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                        <summary>How will lessons be conducted?</summary>
                        <p>Most sessions will be conducted remotely via Zoom, in groups of about 5 students. We will be offer some in-person sessions at the Brookline Teen Center, but they will not be guaranteed to anyone. See our Classes tab to see what content in covered in each lesson. Visit our logistics tab for more information.</p>

                        <summary>How frequently do lessons take place?</summary>
                        <p>Students are expected to be able to commit to two 60 minute sessions for each class they enroll in. So, if the student takes a CS, math, and engineering class, the weekly time commitment will be at least 6 hours per week.</p>

                        <summary>What grade levels is gbSTEM for?</summary>
                        <p>We accept students in grades K-8, but our courses are designed for grades 2-8 so unless a K-1 student has really high mathematical ability, they will most likely not be able to participate in the program. Most of our courses are designed for students in grades 5-7.</p>

                        <summary>Can I join both the Computer Science, Mathematics, and Engineering track?</summary>
                        <p>Yes, but you need to be sure that you are able to manage the time commitment of 6 hours a week of lessons, in addition to the work spent at home practicing the material.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Do I need any prior coding experience?</summary>
                        <p>No prior coding experience is needed -- we welcome coders of all skill levels! In fact, most of our students have not coded before participating in the gbSTEM program.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>I have a bit of coding experience. Should I still join the program?</summary>
                        <p>Yes! If you are already familiar with coding basics, you may be able to enroll in a more difficult course such as Python or Java.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Which programming languages are offered?</summary>
                        <p>We offer introductory courses in Scratch, Python, Java, and web development with HTML and CSS.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Which programming language should I pick?</summary>
                        <p>After taking the placement test (located in the classes tab of this website), you will be provided with all possible CS courses the student has sufficient background to take. From this list of possible courses, we suggest picking the more difficult of the possible courses, as this would likely provide an optimal level of challenge. Specifically, Scratch is the easiest course, followed by Python or Web development, followed by Java.</p>

                        <summary>Do I need to take the Scratch course before taking the Python/Java course?</summary>
                        <p>No, each of our courses are introductory and stand-alone. However, if you have experience in Scratch and/or already have a grasp on some programming concepts, you may be able to proceed faster when taking the Python/Java courses.</p>

                        <summary>What does a typical lesson in the Computer Science track look like?</summary>
                        <p>Our lessons are typically an hour long each and will consist of a "lesson" portion and a "mini-project" portion. During the "lesson" portion, instructors will introduce students to a new programming concept. During the "mini-project" portion, students will code a small project that applies the topics and skills learned in the lesson.</p>

                        <p>Yes, but we recommend enrolling in what the placement test suggests.</p>

                        <summary>Can I learn competition math / math not covered in typical K-12 school curricula?</summary>
                        <p>Yes. All of our courses will include material not typically covered in the recommended grade levels. Our Mathematics V course focuses almost entirely on competition math and problem-solving strategies.</p>

                        <summary>What does a typical lesson in the Mathematics track look like?</summary>
                        <p>We will begin with a brief lecture; this will last about ten minutes. Afterwards, students will work on problems, either individually or in groups. They can receive help and support from the instructor at any point during the lesson.</p>
