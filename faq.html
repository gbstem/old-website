                        <summary>Do I need any prior coding experience?</summary>
                        <p>No prior coding experience is needed -- we welcome coders of all skill levels! In fact, most of our students have not coded before participating in the gbSTEM program.</p>

                        <summary>I have a bit of coding experience. Should I still join the program?</summary>
                        <p>Yes! If you are already familiar with coding basics, you may be able to enroll in a more difficult course such as Python II or Java.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Which programming language should I pick?</summary>
                        <p>We suggest picking the courses that interest you! Typically, Scratch is the easiest language to learn, followed by Python and Web Development (HTML and CSS), followed by Java. We also offer multiple course levels for some languages.

                        <summary>Do I need to take the Scratch course before taking the Python/Java course?</summary>
                        <p>No, each of our courses are introductory and stand-alone. However, if you have experience in Scratch and/or already have a grasp on some programming concepts, you may be able to proceed faster when taking the Python/Java courses.</p>

                        <summary>What does a typical lesson in the Computer Science track look like?</summary>
                        <p>Our lessons are typically an hour long each and will consist of a "lesson" portion and a "mini-project" portion. During the "lesson" portion, instructors will introduce students to a new programming concept. During the "mini-project" portion, students will code a small project that applies the topics and skills learned in the lesson.</p>
