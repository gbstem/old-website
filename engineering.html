                <p1>Students looking to enroll in Mathematics I should be comfortable with the number system, as well as with addition and subtraction of numbers less than 100. They should already be able to identify two-dimensional shapes, add and subtract multiples of 10, and tell time on an analog clock.</p1>
                <h2>What will this course cover?</h2>
                <p1>In Mathematics I, we will enhance the school curriculum for grades 3-4. We will establish familiarity with addition and subtraction of larger numbers. Then we will proceed onto basic multiplication, area and perimeter, fractions, and negative numbers. Since most of the students are very young, this will be a slower-paced course, with lots of individualized time for each student.</p1>

                <h2>Are you ready?</h2>
                <p1>If you are looking to enroll your child in Mathematics II, they should already be comfortable with the addition and subtraction of numbers up to 1000. They should also be familiar with multiplication and division up until 10 x 10. They should understand how to round numbers, compare fractions, and estimate the answers to addition and subtraction problems.</p1>
                <h2>What will this course cover?</h2>
                <p1>In this class, we will begin building the foundations of algebra. After solidifying their multiplication and division skills, students will begin solving one-step equations and more complicated word problems. We will also introduce negative numbers, decimals, and more advanced area and perimeter problems. Our goal is to equip students with the critical thinking and problem-solving skills that will help them succeed in middle school and beyond. </p1>
