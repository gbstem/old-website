                        <p1>"We are grateful for gbSTEM. Our children (ages 8 and 11) are learning fundamental programming concepts while also having fun. The private nature of the lessons allows them to go at their own pace and be focused and engaged. Thank you to all of the amazing tutors!"</p1>

                        <p1>"My son is engaged in content areas that he's genuinely excited about, with a peer of his choice, and learning from older students. gbSTEM was providing live lessons long before PSB [the Public Schools of Brookline] were able to, and I especially appreciated the structure that provided during a time of great uncertainty and stress."</p1>

                        <p1>gbSTEM provided some much-needed intellectual stimulation for my kids, especially during this period of remote learning when the curriculum being provided by school (especially in math) has not been challenging. Thank you gbSTEM!"</p1>

                        <p1>The instructor provided extra help when needed, and she understood that the students enrolled were very young. She tried to accommodate everyone and taught at a slower pace.</p1>
