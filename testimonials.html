                    <p>"We are grateful for gbSTEM. Our children (ages 8 and 11) are learning fundamental programming concepts while also having fun. The private nature of the lessons allows them to go at their own pace and be focused and engaged. Thank you to all of the amazing tutors!"</p>

                    <p>"My son is engaged in content areas that he's genuinely excited about, with a peer of his choice, and learning from older students. gbSTEM was providing live lessons long before PSB [the Public Schools of Brookline] were able to, and I especially appreciated the structure that provided during a time of great uncertainty and stress."</p>

                    <p>""gbSTEM is fantastic! The tutors are kind and engaging, and the curriculum is tailored to each student's individual needs. My daughter is beginning to love computer science, and her math grades have improved as well!"</p>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <p>"My kids are having great fun creating their own code and running their own computer programs. It gives them a great deal of satisfaction when their programs run successfully. I am very glad that they are able to pick up some programming skills in just a few weeks.</p>
                    <p>My daughter likes math and it is great that gbSTEM provides the opportunity for her to learn more and be challenged."</p>

                    <p>"gbSTEM is an innovative program that met a need for out-of-school time enrichment for children by rallying the knowledge and skills of some truly amazing high school students."</p>

                    <p>"I'm super impressed that this was all put together by high school students and that all instructors are teaching for free.</p>
                    <p>gbSTEM provided some much-needed intellectual stimulation for my kids, especially during this period of remote learning when the curriculum being provided by school (especially in math) has not been challenging. Thank you gbSTEM!"</p>

                    <p>"My daughter really enjoyed her Scratch class. The instructor provided extra help when needed, and she understood that the students enrolled were very young. She tried to accommodate everyone and taught at a slower pace.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for introducing my daughter to Scratch! It was a wonderful experience."</p>
